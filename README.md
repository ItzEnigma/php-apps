2. Navigate to the application directory.
3. Copy the application folder to the `htdocs` directory in the `XAMPP` or `WAMP` installation directory.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/application-folder-name` to view the application.
5. To view the database's table, navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` and create a new database and table.

- **Dockerfile:** is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
- **docker-compose.yml:** is a YAML file that defines how Docker containers should behave in production.

> âœ… To build the application created using Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your machine then:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the application directory.
3. Run the following command to build the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
# To remove the container after stopping it
docker-compose down
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view/add the database's table _(`PHPmyAdmin` Dashboard)_.
